# Hiking Club Back End API

This repo holds the back end API server for the Hiking Club web app

## Getting Started

To build and run the API you need npm and node installed, then just run the following commands:
- `npm install` to install needed modules
- `npm run db:init` to create and setup the database
- `npm run build` to transpile the ES6 source
- `npm start` to start the server!

## Running Tests

Running the test is as simple as running `npm test` after installing dependencies

Tests have been written with Jest and cover each API endpoint
